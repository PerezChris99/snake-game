# snake-game
simple snake game made in python.
in this game, you(the snake) are supposed to eat food that makes the snake longer by one fragment and make sure you do not collide with the walls and the snake body itself.
the longer the snake grows, the harder the game gets because it is easy to bite yourself with a long body.
all the scores are monitored and increase with each bite taken.
when the game is over and a new one starts, your aim is to exceed the previous score.
have fun.
